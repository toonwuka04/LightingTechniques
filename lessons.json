    "detail_text1": "The key in Rembrandt lighting is creating the triangle or diamond shape of light underneath the eye. One side of the face is lit well from the main light source while the other side of the face uses the interaction of shadows and light, also known as chiaroscuro, to create this geometric form on the face. The triangle should be no longer than the nose and no wider than the eye. This technique may be achieved subtly or very dramatically by altering the distance between subject and lights and relative strengths of main and fill lights.",

    "detail_text1": "We call this kind of light chiaroscuro. In art, it is the use of strong contrast between light and dark, shadows with fast falloff, and bold contrasts affecting a whole composition. When we see it in paintings like this, it is defined as tenebrism.\n\nTenebrism is from the Italian \"tenebroso\" which means \"dark, gloomy, mysterious.\"  This is occasionally called dramatic illumination and is a style of painting using especially pronounced chiaroscuro lighting, where we get violent contrasts of light and dark, and where darkness becomes a dominating feature of the image.\n\nAnd there's a lot of darkness in betrayal. What I think we can learn from this stuff is just the way story is framed. It's the ultimate \"Show, don't tell.\"\n\nSee how Judas is leaning in with a nefarious glint in his eyes?\nAnd Jesus is leaning back, still with some resistance to being killed?\nYou see John fleeing in the background while Peter does battle. There's an entire story here in just one frame. It helps that I went to 12 years of Catholic school, but even if you didn't, you could still infer a lot of these detail.",
    "detail_text2": "Chiaroscuro is an Italian term which literally means 'light-dark'. In paintings the description refers to clear tonal contrasts which are often used to suggest the volume and modelling of the subjects depicted. Artists who are famed for the use of chiaroscuro include Leonardo da Vinci and Caravaggio. Leonardo employed it to give a vivid impression of the three-dimensionality of his figures, while Caravaggio used such contrasts for the sake of drama. Both artists were also aware of the emotional impact of these effects.",

He did this with haystacks, water lilies, the Rouen Cathedral, and the Waterloo Bridge, just to name a few. Whilst I’m unsure if Monet was the first to do such a thing, he was certainly the first to practice it to such an extreme.",
    "detail_text2": "Despite not being a traditionally Impressionist painting, Monet's love of natural light can be seen in both of his earliest recognized works. The low lit dark tones of Green Dress and the natural summer sunlight of the Garden are a perfect display of Monet's early palette range. In Green Dress, Monet studies how light reacts upon touching various colors on his model. The dark blacks and browns of her fur coat seem as endless and as the darkened background behind her, whilst the low lighting seems to illuminate the lighter colors that she is clad in. The green of her dress is vibrantly portrayed and the minute amount of her skin on display radiates color against the low-lit room. Monet's interest in the study of color is on display again in the Garden. The beautifully lit day makes the white dress of his model and the freshly cut green grass see even more radiant. Monet's use of shadows and dark tonal shades of black further accentuate this.",

Nocturnal Scenes: His paintings often depict nocturnal scenes, further emphasizing the dramatic effects of the lighting.",

Rim Lighting: Leonardo also used a technique of adding a rim light from behind the subject to prevent the shadow of the face from blending into the background, as explained in this YouTube video. Background Lighting: He would also add light to the background rather than the sitter, arranging figures against a light background when in shadow, and against a dark background when illuminated, as explained in this YouTube video. In summary, Leonardo da Vinci's mastery of light and shadow, achieved through chiaroscuro and sfumato, created a new level of realism and emotional depth in his paintings, influencing generations of artists.",
